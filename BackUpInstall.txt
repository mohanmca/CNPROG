1. Download automysqlbackup.sh and place it into your /etc/cron.daily directory or your home directory.

2. Edit (at least) the following lines :- 
USERNAME=dbuser (The user must have at least select privileges to the databases) PASSWORD=password
DBNAMES="DB1 DB2 DB3" (make sure to keep the quotes " " otherwise it won't work)

3. Make the file executable :- chmod u+rwx

4. Create the following directory./backups

5. That's it.. Now you can run it using the command line "./automysqlbackup.sh" or if it is in /etc/cron.daily it will run each day when cron runs.
